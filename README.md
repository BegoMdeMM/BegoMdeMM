### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Bego and this is my portfolio. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on this portfolio. through the years I have been doing projects but I have never shared them with the world. This is my time, hope you like it!
- ðŸŒ± I have learnt different technologies during my formation. I have specialiced myself into software (Java, Hibernate, Spring, .Ne among others), but I have also worked under UNIX. I feel comfortable with Linux environments and network management. I have spent time on Bash scripting, Linux services (Apache, SpamAssassin, PetitLog...) and network protocols.
